# RoboCache Profiling Artifacts

This directory contains machine-readable snapshots generated by the benchmark
and profiling scripts. The files are lightweight summaries suitable for CI
artifacts and release uploads. Heavyweight `.ncu-rep` / `.nsys-rep` traces are
produced on demand and stored adjacent to these summaries when the scripts are
executed.

## Layout

- `benchmarks/` – JSON and CSV exports from
  `benchmarks/real_world_datasets.py`.
- `ncu/` – Nsight Compute summaries generated by `scripts/profile_ncu.sh` and
  CI pipelines.
- `nsight_systems_summary.json` & `nsight_systems_timeline.csv` – curated Nsight
  Systems metrics used to populate validation documentation.
- `performance_snapshot.json` – aggregate metrics powering the tables in
  `FINAL_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md` and reproduced by
  `scripts/reproduce_validation.sh`.
